#NUMBER:        IN-BANDWITH     OUT-BANDWIDTH   OPTIONS         REDIRECTED
#INTERFACE                                                      INTERFACES
##Following instructions from http://www.ckollars.org/shaping.html
# These available bandwidth numbers should mesh with reality, so if our ISP
#  changes our service these should change.
# Note we limit out-bandwidth to considerably less than the modem is capable
#  of because inbound traffic _always_ predominates at IMHS.
# Also note we specify an in-bandwidth of 0, which means no qdisc is assigned
#  to the inbound direction of the interface. This is quicker and it eliminates
#  any possibility of the "Classifier actions preferred over netfilter" message.
#  But it means we don't control ingress at all so packets _could_ back up
#  in a queue somewhere inside our ISP.
