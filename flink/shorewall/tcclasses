#INTERFACE:CLASS        MARK    RATE:           CEIL    PRIORITY        OPTIONS
#                               DMAX:UMAX
##Following instructions from http://www.ckollars.org/shaping.html
# We use
#  mark/prio 1 for interactive (only remote administration, very little),
#  mark/prio 2 for DNS (normally much much less, this is a worst case ceiling,
#   the high priority is to minimize hangs as much as possible)
#  mark/prio 3 for email in (usually uses above allocations too, runs quickly
#   when needed, but just passes allocation down most of the time),
#  mark/prio 4 for web (main legitimate use),
#  and mark/prio 5 is everything else (i.e. P2P, MMORPG, "bulk", etc.)
#   (last class is assumed to contain most discouraged uses and little else)
# Class 5 guaranteed rate is very small to reduce
#  responsiveness so much MMORPGs aren't usable - mostly class 5 bandwidth
#  depends on "surplus" bandwidth cascading down unused from higher 
#  priorities, and as a result is too bursty for interactive use
$WAN_IF:15            5       10*full/100          9*full/10    5  default
$WAN_IF:14            4       60*full/100          full    4
$WAN_IF:13            3       15*full/100          full    3
$WAN_IF:12            2       10*full/100          full    2
$WAN_IF:11            1       5*full/100           full    1
#                       Note sum of RATEs is exactly 100%.
#
# Placing a CEIL other than "full" (or almost-full?) on the last
#  class slows our web responsiveness noticeably (!?) - some sort of interaction
#  with our ISP seems the most likely explanation; maybe enforcement of CEIL
#  introduces short quiet periods and our ISP interprets those quiet periods
#  as our needing less bandwidth...  otherwise it might be prudent to 
#  specify CEIL as 9*full/10 as yet one more method of enforcing that no
#  one class could ever completely exclude other classes no matter what
